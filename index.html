            <p> For many years Iâ€™ve had the privilege to visit nursing homes as I truly enjoy spending time with the
                elderly. I sing and teach Bible studies and appreciate hearing about their former lives. The Lord has
                allowed me to make some precious friendships and I want to share with you about a lovely lady who after
                a
                devastating stroke was no longer able to be independent and is now in a comfortable setting where she is
                well taken care of.</p>

                <p>2020 has taken its toll not only across all regions and virtually all countries, but also on the full
                    range
                    of our human rights, be they economic, social, cultural, civil or political. COVID-19 has zeroed in
                    on the
                    fissures and fragilities in our societies, exposing all our failures to invest in building fair and
                    equitable societies. </p>
